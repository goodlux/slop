# Testing Graph Storage

This is a test slop to verify that:
- Entities are being extracted by GLiNER2
- RDF quads are being generated
- N-Quads are being sent to the web server
- Oxigraph is receiving and storing the data

Key people involved: Alice, Bob, and Charlie from Anthropic.
They're working on knowledge graphs in San Francisco.
