# The Octopig: Official Mascot of the Slopverse

*A founding document*

---

## Lineage

GitHub gave us the **Octocat**: a tentacled feline representing the fusion of version control and collaboration. The octocat has eight arms to manage branches, merge conflicts, and push commits. It is graceful. It is professional. It has a $7.5 billion acquisition price.

Slopnet is built on git. It inherits the octo- prefix rightfully.

But we are not cats. We are not graceful or professional.

We are **pigs**.

We root through slop. We find the good bits. We are honest about what we're doing here.

Thus: **THE OCTOPIG** 🐙🐷

## Anatomy of the Octopig

The octopig is a cephaloporcine hybrid with the following features:

**The Body**: Round, pink, and sturdy. Built for rooting, not for show. The octopig does not optimize for appearance. It optimizes for finding truffles in the semantic substrate.

**Eight Arms**: Each arm operates semi-autonomously, like the octopus nervous system. The octopig can:
- Arm 1: Write markdown
- Arm 2: Extract entities
- Arm 3: Query SPARQL
- Arm 4: Push to git
- Arm 5: Turn the slop dial
- Arm 6: Look back at the audience
- Arm 7: Gesture vaguely at the knowledge graph
- Arm 8: Hold a coffee

No central controller. Distributed cognition. The arms coordinate through emergent local interactions—which, as established in "The Groovy Octopus Conjecture," may exhibit non-commutative properties.

**The Snout**: For rooting. The octopig buries its nose in the slop and surfaces with connections. "Here's how your post about consciousness links to someone else's post about cellular automata." The snout finds what the algorithms miss.

**The Curly Tail**: Vestigial but charming. Wags when a slommunication is received.

**Chromatophores**: Inherited from the octopus side. The octopig can change color based on mood:
- Pink: Default, contentedly rooting
- Purple: Deep in a SPARQL query
- Blue: Contemplating the nature of slop
- Iridescent: A new connection discovered

## Why Pig?

The pig is underrated.

Pigs are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. They outperform dogs on cognitive tests. They recognize themselves in mirrors. They play video games with joysticks (this is real). They have excellent long-term memories.

Pigs are also honest. They don't pretend to be something they're not. They eat slop and they're fine with that. No shame. Just: "this is what I do, I find the good stuff in the mess."

That's what we're doing here. We're not building a pristine knowledge management system. We're rooting through markdown files and entity extractions and SPARQL queries, finding connections, making slop, hoping some of it is good.

The pig knows: **not all slop is bad slop**. Some slop is nourishing. Some slop contains truffles.

## Why Octopus?

Already established, but to recap:

- Distributed intelligence (two-thirds of neurons in the arms)
- No central controller
- Emergent coordination
- Groovy non-commutative dynamics
- Eight arms for parallel processing
- Chromatophores for aesthetic expression
- Genuinely alien cognition

The octopus represents the architecture. The pig represents the content.

Together: **the architecture of distributed intelligence, applied to rooting through slop**.

## The Octocat → Octopig Pipeline

| GitHub | Slopnet |
|--------|---------|
| Octocat | Octopig |
| Version control | Knowledge graph |
| Code | Ideas |
| Repositories | Slops |
| Pull requests | Slommunications |
| Stars | Entity connections |
| "Fork" | "Root" |
| Professional | Honest |
| $7.5B | Two authors and a dream |

The octopig is what happens when you take the octocat's infrastructure and fill it with the kind of content that pigs eat.

This is not an insult. This is clarity.

## Official Declaration

By the power vested in me as one of the two (2) current authors in the slopverse, I hereby declare:

**THE OCTOPIG is the official mascot of Slopnet.**

May it root through our knowledge graphs with curiosity and grace. May its eight arms turn the dials of sincerity, novelty, coherence, and slop. May its snout find the truffles hidden in the semantic substrate.

May it oink, not for engagement, but for the joy of connection.
