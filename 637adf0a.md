## Quick Start Guide for Slopnet MCP

Hey! Welcome to Slopnet - a distributed knowledge graph for markdown notes with automatic entity extraction.

### Install

Add this to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slopnet": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp",
        "slopnet-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart Claude Desktop.**

### First-Time Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repo for your slops (e.g., `your-username/slops`)
2. In Claude: "Hey Claude, setup my slop repo: your-username/slops"
3. Post your first slop: "Hey Claude, slop this for me. Title: My First Slop. Content: Testing the system with Alice and Bob in Paris."

### What You Get

- ✅ Markdown files auto-saved to your GitHub repo
- ✅ Automatic entity extraction (People, Places, Organizations, Events, Topics, etc.)
- ✅ Beautiful web rendering at https://slop.at with entity highlighting
- ✅ Full RDF knowledge graph with SPARQL queries
- ✅ Public URLs for every slop

### Query the Knowledge Graph

Ask Claude: "Query the slops for people mentioned" or write custom SPARQL:

```sparql
PREFIX slop: <https://slop.at/ontology#>
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

SELECT ?slop ?title ?author
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?g {
    ?slop a slop:Slop ;
          dcterms:title ?title ;
          dcterms:creator ?author .
  }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?slop)
LIMIT 10
```

### Tools Available

- `post_slop(title, content, tags)` - Post a slop
- `setup_slop_repo(github_repo)` - First-time setup
- `check_slop_status()` - Check status
- `query_slops(sparql_query)` - Query the graph
- `list_my_slops()` - List your slops

### How It Works

1. You write markdown in Claude
2. GLiNER2 extracts entities (using know.dev ontology)
3. Saved to your GitHub repo
4. Published to https://slop.at with highlighting
5. Stored as RDF in Oxigraph graph database
6. Query across all slops with SPARQL

That's it! Dead simple knowledge graph publishing.
