## Working Installation Instructions for Slopnet MCP

**The Problem:** Claude Desktop has a 60-second timeout, but downloading ML dependencies (PyTorch, GLiNER2) takes 1-2 minutes on first install. This causes timeout errors.

**The Solution:** Pre-install dependencies before adding to Claude Desktop config.

### Step 1: Pre-install Dependencies

Run this in your terminal and wait for completion (~2 minutes):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp slopnet-mcp --help
```

You'll see it downloading:
- torch (143.8MB)
- transformers (11.4MB)  
- onnxruntime (18.3MB)
- And other dependencies

**Wait for it to complete!** This caches everything for future use.

### Step 2: Add to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slopnet": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp",
        "slopnet-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

The MCP will connect successfully because dependencies are already cached.

### First-Time Setup

1. Create a GitHub repo for your slops (e.g., `your-username/slops`)
2. In Claude: "Hey Claude, setup my slop repo: your-username/slops"  
3. Post your first slop: "Hey Claude, slop this for me. Title: My First Slop. Content: Testing with Alice and Bob in Paris."

### What You Get

- ✅ Markdown files auto-saved to your GitHub repo
- ✅ Automatic entity extraction (People, Places, Organizations, Events, Topics)
- ✅ Beautiful web rendering at https://slop.at with entity highlighting
- ✅ Full RDF knowledge graph with SPARQL queries
- ✅ Public URLs for every slop

### Troubleshooting

**If you still get timeout errors:**
The pre-install didn't complete. Run it again:
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp slopnet-mcp --help
```

**Test if it's working:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp slopnet-mcp
# Should start the MCP server without errors
```

### Why This Happens

- `uvx` installs packages in an isolated environment
- GLiNER2 requires large ML libraries (PyTorch, etc.)
- First download takes >60 seconds
- Claude Desktop times out waiting
- Pre-installing caches everything
- Subsequent starts are instant
