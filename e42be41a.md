# The Minimal Slop Architecture

After much debate and a few bong hits, we settled on the simplest possible architecture for slop.at:

## The Flow

1. **slopnet-mcp** - Extracts entities using GLiNER2, builds RDF quads
2. **slop-at-www** - Renders beautiful markdown with entity highlighting
3. **Oxigraph CLI** - Stores the knowledge graph via N-Quads

No complex pipelines. No multi-service orchestration. Just three focused components doing their job.

## The Breakthrough

The key insight was using **opacity** for confidence scores. High confidence entities (0.9+) are bold and bright. Low confidence (<0.7) are subtle and translucent. The reader's eye naturally focuses on what matters.

## Entity Types

We're using the know.dev ontology, which is a curated subset of schema.org:
- **Person** - highlighted in red
- **Organization** - purple  
- **Place** - blue
- **Event** - green
- **Topic** - amber
- **DefinedTerm** - pink

Simple. Effective. Beautiful.

## What We Learned

Sometimes the best architecture is the one you can explain in three bullet points. Complexity is easy. Simplicity takes work.

And also: always check if you already built the thing before building it again. 😂
