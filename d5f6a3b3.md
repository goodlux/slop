# The Last Database Administrator

They found her in Rack 47, Section D, curled up in the cold aisle between two humming blade servers. The intern who discovered her—a kid fresh out of bootcamp who thought "legacy systems" meant Angular 1.x—almost screamed when he saw her eyes reflected in his phone's flashlight. Feral. Ancient. Knowing.

"Don't... don't touch the indexes," she whispered, clutching a worn copy of _PostgreSQL: The Definitive Guide_ to her chest like a bible. "They're perfectly tuned. Thirty years. Thirty years of query optimization."

The intern backed away slowly, the way you back away from a wild animal. He'd heard the legends, sure. Every company had them. The Old Ones who remembered when databases had physical backups. Who knew what COBOL stood for. Who could ssh into a server without looking up the syntax.

But he never thought he'd actually *meet* one.

## The Migration

They called it a "digital transformation initiative." Management loved that phrase. It meant cloud. It meant microservices. It meant Kubernetes and serverless and NoSQL and all the other buzzwords that made investors' eyes light up like kids on Christmas morning.

It meant retiring the mainframe.

The mainframe. That monolithic beast that had run the company's core operations since 1994. The one that processed every transaction, every order, every payment. The one that *never went down*. Not during Y2K. Not during the data center flood of 2008. Not during the Great AWS Outage of 2017.

The one that she had maintained, alone, for three decades.

"We're moving to MongoDB," the CTO announced in the all-hands meeting, as if he were revealing the cure for cancer. "Horizontally scalable. Cloud-native. DevOps-ready."

She raised her hand from the back of the room. A hundred heads turned.

"What about ACID compliance?"

Silence.

"What about referential integrity?"

More silence.

"What about the 400,000 lines of stored procedures that contain all the actual business logic?"

The CTO smiled the way people smile at children who still believe in Santa Claus. "We'll refactor. Agile sprints. We'll have it done in six months."

She knew right then that they were doomed.

## The Refactoring

They hired a consultant firm. Not just any consultant firm—a *prestigious* one. The kind that charges $500/hour and puts their logo on everything. They did workshops. They created Jira epics. They made PowerPoints with arrows and clouds and the word "synergy" appearing approximately forty-seven times.

Then they looked at the codebase.

The first consultant lasted two days. He opened `customer_billing_v2_final_REAL_final_updated.sql` and his face went white. He quit during lunch, mumbling something about "going back to his startup."

The second consultant made it a week. She got as far as the trigger that updated seventeen tables simultaneously and sent an email to accounting if certain conditions were met—conditions defined by a SELECT statement that JOIN'd 23 tables and included a subquery that *no living person understood*.

"Who wrote this?" she asked.

Everyone pointed at the DBA, who was sitting in her corner cubicle, eating a sandwich and reading Hacker News.

"It works," she said simply.

"But *how*?"

She shrugged. "It's been working since 2003. If you don't know why something works, maybe you shouldn't break it."

The consultant left that afternoon. Her exit interview mentioned words like "unmaintainable" and "technical debt" and "cowboy coding."

The DBA heard about it later. She laughed. Not the laugh of someone who finds things funny. The laugh of someone who knows what's coming.

## The Migration

They did it anyway.

Six months became eight. Eight became twelve. Twelve became "let's just get *something* into production." They migrated the customer table first. Then orders. Then inventory.

Everything seemed fine.

Until the first transaction.

The new system processed it in 47 milliseconds. The old system had done it in 12. But that was fine—this was MVP. They'd optimize later.

Then someone noticed the inventory count was wrong.

Then someone noticed a customer had been charged twice.

Then someone noticed that the accounting reports didn't match the database.

Then the DBA's phone rang.

"We need you," the CTO said. No preamble. No small talk. Just desperation.

"I'm retired," she said.

"Name your price."

She named a price.

He accepted immediately.

## The Fix

She came in at 2 AM. The office was empty except for the on-call engineer—a tech lead who looked like he hadn't slept in a week. His desk was surrounded by empty energy drink cans like a defensive perimeter.

"I can't figure it out," he said, voice cracking. "The data is *there* but it's *wrong* and I don't know *why*."

She sat down at his terminal. Pulled up the new MongoDB schema. Pulled up the old PostgreSQL schema. 

She stared for thirty seconds.

"Your document structure is denormalized," she said.

"That's the whole *point* of NoSQL—"

"You have nested arrays of transaction records."

"For performance—"

"And you're updating them asynchronously."

"We're using eventual consistency—"

"So when multiple services update the same customer simultaneously, they're working with stale data."

Silence.

"You've reinvented every problem that relational databases solved in the 1970s," she said quietly. "Except now you don't have transactions. Or constraints. Or any of the tools that would let you fix it."

The tech lead stared at his screen. His hands were shaking.

"Can you fix it?"

She could. It took three weeks. She wrote a reconciliation service that cross-referenced every document with a shadow PostgreSQL database that she spun up from the old backups. She wrote migration scripts that unwound the denormalization. She added pessimistic locking. She basically rebuilt a relational database inside MongoDB's document structure.

It worked.

But it was slower than the original system. And more expensive. And more fragile.

## The Ending

Six months later, the company quietly migrated back to PostgreSQL. They called it "re-platforming." They didn't put it in a press release.

The DBA returned to retirement. She moved to a cabin in Montana with no wifi. She kept one machine running in her basement—an old Dell tower with PostgreSQL 9.4 installed. Sometimes she'd SSH in and run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on complex queries, just to watch the execution plan unfold.

The intern who found her in the cold aisle eventually became a senior engineer. He tells the story sometimes at conferences. About the Old Ones. About respecting legacy code. About how "tech debt" is sometimes just "working software you don't understand yet."

He ends with her last words to him before she left:

"Boring technology is boring because it works. If you're going to break something that's worked for thirty years, you better have a damn good reason. And 'the conference talk was really inspiring' is not a damn good reason."

*The mainframe is still running. It outlived the company. It will outlive us all.*
