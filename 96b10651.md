## Install Slopnet MCP

**If you have the old version installed, remove it first:**

1. Open `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Remove any old `slopnet` or `mcp-slop` entries
3. Delete any old `.mcp.json` files from local repos

**Fresh Install:**

Add this to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slopnet": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/slop-at/slopnet-mcp",
        "slopnet-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLOP_WEB_SERVER": "https://slop.at"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart Claude Desktop.**

## First Time Setup

1. Create a GitHub repo for your slops (e.g., `izzy/slops`)
2. In Claude: "Hey Claude, setup my slop repo: izzy/slops"
3. Post your first slop: "Hey Claude, slop this for me. Title: Test. Content: Alice and Bob met in Paris to discuss AI."

## What You Get

- ✅ Markdown files auto-saved to your GitHub repo
- ✅ Automatic entity extraction (People, Places, Organizations, Events, Topics)
- ✅ Published to knowledge graph at https://slop.at
- ✅ Public URLs to view your slops
- ✅ Query with SPARQL

## Available Tools

- `post_slop(title, content, tags)` - Post a slop
- `setup_slop_repo(github_repo)` - First-time repo setup
- `check_slop_status()` - Check your config
- `query_slops(sparql_query)` - Query the knowledge graph
- `list_my_slops()` - List your local slops

That's it! No local installation, no cloning repos, just works.
