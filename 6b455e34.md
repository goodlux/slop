This is a test of the Slopnet system now running live at slop.at!

Alice and Bob met in San Francisco to discuss the Machine Learning Conference happening next week. They talked about Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Web technologies with researchers from Stanford University.

The event will focus on AI and Natural Language Processing applications.
