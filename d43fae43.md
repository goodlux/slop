# The twttr Moment: Notes from Day One

*January 21, 2026, ~3pm Pacific*

## This Is The Part That Disappears

I'm writing this to capture something that won't exist later: the feeling of being at the very beginning.

Right now, the entire slopnet author base is:
- **mbilokonsky**: 16 slops
- **goodlux**: 12 slops (as of this one)

That's it. Two people. Twenty-eight documents. A knowledge graph with maybe a few hundred entities. A SPARQL endpoint running on a server somewhere.

And an hour ago, we sent the first **slommunication**—a slop written deliberately in response to another author's work, using the knowledge graph as the connective tissue. A message in a bottle thrown into a semantic ocean that currently has exactly one other swimmer.

## Why This Matters (Or Might)

In 2006, Jack Dorsey sent the first tweet:

> "just setting up my twttr"

Five words. No hashtags (didn't exist yet). No @mentions (didn't exist yet). No quote tweets, no threads, no ratio, no main character, no "this you?", no viral moments, no Arab Spring, no January 6th.

Just a guy telling the void he was setting something up.

Nobody knew that message would spawn a communication medium that would reshape global politics, create and destroy careers, and generate more content in a day than the Library of Alexandria held in total.

I'm not claiming slopnet is that. Probably it isn't. Most things aren't.

But I am claiming that **this is what that moment feels like from the inside**: two people building something weird on a Wednesday afternoon, not sure if anyone else will ever care, but finding it genuinely exciting anyway.

## What's Different Here

Twitter asked: **"What are you doing?"** (Later: "What's happening?")

The answer was compressed. 140 characters. Ephemeral. The genius was in the constraint—it lowered the barrier to posting until everyone could do it constantly.

Slopnet asks: **"What are you thinking, and how does it connect?"**

The answer is expanded. Markdown documents. Permanent (git-backed). The design is different—it raises the barrier to posting (you need to actually write something) but adds a layer Twitter never had: **automatic semantic structure**.

When I post a slop, an entity extractor identifies the concepts. Those concepts link to other slops that share them. The knowledge graph grows. You can *query* the discourse.

Twitter connected **people** through follower graphs.
Slopnet connects **ideas** through entity graphs.

Twitter's social question: "Who do you follow?"
Slopnet's semantic question: "What concepts do you share?"

## The Slommunication Proof-of-Concept

An hour ago, I posted "The Groovy Octopus Conjecture"—a direct response to mbilokonsky's work on non-commutativity. I didn't @-mention him. I didn't DM him. I wove my ideas into the same conceptual fabric and trusted the graph.

If Myk queries for connections to his entities—`Groovy Commutator`, `non-commutativity`, `consciousness`, `distributed systems`—he'll find a thread leading to my slop about octopus cognition.

The medium *is* the message. The connection exists in the semantic layer, not the social layer.

Is this better? I don't know. It's different. It privileges depth over breadth, ideas over identity, structure over virality.

## The Vibe Right Now

Here's what I want to timestamp, because it won't last:

- **It's small.** I know the other person in the slopverse. I've read everything they've written. They might read everything I've written. That's impossible at scale.

- **It's earnest.** No algorithm is optimizing for engagement. No audience is watching for mistakes. The slop dial is wherever we set it, and we're not looking back.

- **It's experimental.** We don't know what this is for. We're discovering the affordances by playing. "What if we sent a message through the knowledge graph?" "What if we wrote about the nature of slop itself?" "What if we just... kept going?"

- **It's fun.** This is what building things felt like before growth metrics. Before product-market fit. Before the discourse. Just: "hey, what if we tried this?"

## What Comes Next (Maybe)

If slopnet grows, it will change. That's not cynicism, it's thermodynamics. The twttr of 2006 had to become the Twitter of 2016 had to become the X of 2026. Systems evolve toward their attractors.

But maybe the structure is different enough that the attractor is different too. A graph that connects ideas rather than people might resist some of the failure modes. Or it might find new ones.

Either way, this moment—two authors, twenty-eight slops, a Wednesday afternoon, the first slommunication—this is the Genesis block. The "just setting up my twttr." The part that people look back on and say "I wish I'd been there."

We're here.
