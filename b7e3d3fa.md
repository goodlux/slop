## Verse 1: The GitHub Question

*Oh, should we store our slops on GitHub's shore?*  
*Or rent a server, pay forevermore?*  
*The captain says: "Git's free for public repos!"*  
*No ops burden, no bills, that's how it goes!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 2: The Familiar Field

*Who did the work? The LLM confessed!*  
*Claude Sonnet 4.5, put to the test,*  
*Model IDs in the frontmatter gleam,*  
*Attribution clear, a transparent dream!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 3: The SIOC Salvation

*"What ontology?" the sailors cried,*  
*SIOC appeared like the rising tide,*  
*Posts and users, topics in between,*  
*The federated web's most perfect scene!*  

*Extend it with your SLOP namespace proud,*  
*Mentions and confidence singing loud,*  
*A minimal ontology file we'll make,*  
*Full OWL/RDFS for federation's sake!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 4: The Heavy MCP vs Server Debate

*Should GLiNER run local, 340 megs strong?*  
*Or server-side extraction all day long?*  
*The answer came: "Why not have both?"*  
*Hybrid architecture, the sacred oath!*  

*Power users keep their desktop might,*  
*Web users post through API light,*  
*Cloudflare Workers spinning on demand,*  
*Every slopper served across the land!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 5: The Synesthesia Highlighting

*"I want my colors!" goodlux decreed,*  
*"Line numbers tracking every NER seed!"*  
*Entities wrapped in rainbow spans,*  
*HSL colors dancing in the hands!*  

*Person is blue at hue 200,*  
*Organization orange, topics purple-plenty,*  
*GitHub anchors #L10-L15,*  
*The most synesthetic site you've seen!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 6: The Two-Layer Graph

*Local Oxigraph for preferences sweet,*  
*"Block @somelameperson," make filtering complete,*  
*Remote graph public, knowledge shared wide,*  
*SPARQL SERVICE joins them side by side!*  

*Private filters, public data flow,*  
*Federated filtering steals the show,*  
*Sync preferences across devices with git,*  
*The architecture's brilliant, you must admit!*  

**Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

## Verse 7: The Classification Finale

*Code or essay, note or tutorial guide?*  
*Simple heuristics turn the tide,*  
*Count the backticks, check for links,*  
*Classification happens in a blink!*  

*Low priority but automatic still,*  
*Let the regex do its will,*  
*Type field added to the frontmatter page,*  
*Every slop tagged for its age!*  

**Final Chorus:**  
*Slop it up, slop it down,*  
*Metadata sailing all around,*  
*RDF triples, entities found,*  
*In the knowledge graph we're bound!*  

*Phase 1: Fix metadata!*  
*Phase 2: Web UI, better!*  
*Phase 3: Federation, later!*  
*The architecture's our narrator!*

## Technical Appendix (Because Even Sea Shanties Need Documentation)

**Recommended Stack:**
- SIOC + PROV-O + custom SLOP vocabulary
- Hybrid architecture: Heavy MCP + optional serverless API
- Local Oxigraph (preferences) + Remote Oxigraph (public graph)
- GitHub Pages with entity highlighting
- Simple classification heuristics

**The Three Phases:**
1. **Now**: Add `familiar` field, create `slop.ttl`, implement classification
2. **Soon**: Static site generator, entity highlighting, GitHub Pages deployment
3. **Later**: Local Oxigraph federation, SPARQL SERVICE queries, web API

*"Why use 47 AWS services when Supabase go brrr?"* 🐐✨  
*(And why use one architecture when you can slop 'em all together?)* 🎵
