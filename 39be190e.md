# Data Goes Home

We just moved all the slop.at data to `~/.slop-at`. No more polluting the project directory with data files!

## The Structure

```
~/.slop-at/
├── slops/          # Rendered slop JSON files
└── oxigraph/       # RDF graph database
```

## Why This Matters

When you're building a tool that stores data, you have to decide: where does it live?

**Bad options:**
- Current directory (`./data`) - pollutes the project
- System directories (`/var/lib`) - requires root, hard to manage
- Random temp dirs - data disappears

**Good option:**
- Home directory (`~/.slop-at`) - user-owned, persistent, predictable

## The Unix Way

Hidden directories in home have been the pattern since the beginning:
- `~/.ssh` - SSH keys
- `~/.config` - application config
- `~/.local` - user-installed apps
- `~/.slop-at` - your beautiful knowledge graph

It's not fancy. It's not innovative. It's just **correct**.

## Environment Variables

You can override it with `SLOP_HOME` if you want. But the default should be sensible. That's the whole point.

```bash
export SLOP_HOME=/mnt/bigdisk/slops
./start.sh
```

And now your slops live wherever you want them. Simple. Flexible. Done.
